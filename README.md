This project hosts a service where the user can select which human body system is in pain. From 
there the user will be given common symptoms that occur in diseases within the selected body system. 
After selecting the symptom, the user will be given the name of an over the counter medication that 
can be bought without a doctors prescription at a local pharmacy. This website saves the time and 
hassle of going to the doctors for a mild sickness, and gives medication utilized for that body
system and symptom. We created a data base with more than 65 over the counter medications for 
different systems in the body as well as different symptoms within each system.

This website was created using ReactJS along with the Material UI library for Cutie Hack 2022.
